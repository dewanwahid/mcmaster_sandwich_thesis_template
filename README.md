# McMaster University Sandwich Thesis Template

I modified [McMaster University's general latex thesis format](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/mcmaster-thesis-example/bjccppctqwgt) for Sandwich types dissertation. That means, each of your chapters (except introduction and conclusion) is a published article!


### Run This Project
You can use any standard LaTeX distribution (e.g., [MikTeX](https://miktex.org/)) along with a LaTeX studio (e.g. [TexStudio](https://www.texstudio.org/)) to run it. Most convinient way is to upload it at [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) as a project.
